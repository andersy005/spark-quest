Until you have tested and proven to yourself that your data is in a clean state, you should neither trust it nor use it for modeling.\n\nYour data can be stained with duplicates, missing observations and outliers, non-existent addresses, wrong phone numbers and area codes, inaccurate geographical coordinates, wrong dates, incorrect labels, mixtures of upper and lower cases, trailing spaces, and many other more subtle problems. It is your job to clean it, irrespective of whether you are a data scientist or data engineer, so you can build a statistical or machine learning model.\n\n\nYour dataset is considered technically clean if none of the aforementioned problems can be found. However, to clean the dataset for modeling purposes, you also need to check the distributions of your features and confirm they fit the predefined criteria."],"metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"name":"04-Prepare-Data-for-Modeling","notebookId":836708506337496},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
