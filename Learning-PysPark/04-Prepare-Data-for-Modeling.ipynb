Until you have tested and proven to yourself that your data is in a clean state, you should neither trust it nor use it for modeling.\n\nYour data can be stained with duplicates, missing observations and outliers, non-existent addresses, wrong phone numbers and area codes, inaccurate geographical coordinates, wrong dates, incorrect labels, mixtures of upper and lower cases, trailing spaces, and many other more subtle problems. It is your job to clean it, irrespective of whether you are a data scientist or data engineer, so you can build a statistical or machine learning model.\n\n\nYour dataset is considered technically clean if none of the aforementioned problems can be found. However, to clean the dataset for modeling purposes, you also need to check the distributions of your features and confirm they fit the predefined criteria.\n\nAs a data scientist, you can expect to spend 80-90% of your time **massaging** your data and getting familiar with all the features. This chapter will guide you through that process, leveraging Spark capabilities."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Duplicates\n[back to top](#Table-of-Contents)\n\nDuplicates are observations that appear as distinct rows in your dataset, but which, upon closer inspection, look the same. That is, if you looked at them side by side, all the features in these two (or more) rows would have exactly the same values.\n\nOn the other hand, if your data has some form of an ID to distinguish between records (or associate them with certain users, for example), then what might initially appear as a duplicate may not be; sometimes systems fail and produce erroneous IDs.

You have to be careful not to drop too many: depending on the distribution of the missing values across your dataset it might severely affect the usability of your dataset. If, after dropping the rows, I end up with a very small dataset, or find that the reduction in data size is more than 50%, I start checking my data to see what features have the most holes in them and perhaps exclude those altogether; if a feature has most of its values missing (unless a missing value bears a meaning), from a modeling point of view, it is fairly useless.\n\nThe other way to deal with the observations with missing values is to impute some value in place of those Nones. Given the type of your data, you have several options to choose from:\n\n\n\n- If your data is a discrete Boolean, you can turn it into a categorical variable by adding a third category â€” Missing\n- If your data is already categorical, you can simply extend the number of levels and add the Missing category as well\n- If you're dealing with ordinal or numerical data, you can impute either mean, median, or some other predefined value (for example, first or third quartile, depending on the distribution shape of your data)"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_miss = spark.createDataFrame([\n        (1, 143.5, 5.6, 28,   'M',  100000),\n        (2, 167.2, 5.4, 45,   'M',  None),\n        (3, None , 5.2, None, None, None),\n        (4, 144.5, 5.9, 33,   'M',  None),\n        (5, 133.2, 5.7, 54,   'F',  None),\n        (6, 124.1, 5.2, None, 'F',  None),\n        (7, 129.2, 5.3, 42,   'M',  76000),\n    ], ['id', 'weight', 'height', 'age', 'gender', 'income'])"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To find the number of missing observations per row we can use the following snippet."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_miss.rdd.map(\n             lambda row: (row['id'], sum([c == None for c in row]))).collect()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To see what values are missing, we count missing observations in columns we can decide to drop the observation altogether or impute some of the observations."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_miss.where('id == 3').show()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Here is what we get:\n![](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-pyspark/9781786463708/graphics/B05793_04_08.jpg)"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Let's now check what percentage of missing observations are there in each column:"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_miss.agg(*[\n    (1 - (fn.count(c) / fn.count('*'))).alias(c + '_missing')\n    for c in df_miss.columns\n  ]).show()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This is what we get\n![](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-pyspark/9781786463708/graphics/B05793_04_09.jpg)\n\n**Note:**\n\nThe ```*``` argument to the ```.count(...)``` method (in place of a column name) instructs the method to count all rows.

This method accepts a single integer (long is also accepted), float, or string; all missing values in the whole dataset will then be filled in with that value.
